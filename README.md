## Introduction
This project uses linear regression to predict salaries based on years of experience and other factors. Predicting salaries accurately can help businesses make informed decisions about compensation and workforce planning.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of employee information collected from various companies. Data preprocessing involved cleaning missing values and scaling numerical features. Exploratory data analysis revealed strong correlations between years of experience and salary.

## Methodology
- **EDA**: Scatter plots and histograms were used to visualize relationships between variables.
- **Model Selection**: Linear regression was chosen due to its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:R-squared were used to evaluate model performance.

## Results
The linear regression model achieved an R-squared of 0.90, indicating strong predictive power. Significant factors influencing salary included years of experience
